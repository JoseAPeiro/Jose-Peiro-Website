                <p> 
                Being part of a team brimming with talent, enthusiasm, and an amazing vibe has been a truly unforgettable journey. 
                The skills I've gained from this experience are priceless and will greatly benefit my future in the industry. 
                It also solidified my belief that choosing to venture into game development years ago was the smartest move I've ever made.

                <h3>My Participation</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to a NDA, I cannot showcase any of my work, however, I can describe my participation and collaboration at Liquid Ice Studios.

                <p>
                    As the Game Design Intern, I was responsible for maintaining a smooth flow of communication between all team members, 
                    ensuring that everyone was aligned and informed throughout the project. My role involved a significant amount of documentation work, 
                    where I meticulously filled out the Game Design Document (GDD) to capture the project's vision, goals, and progress. 
                    I documented game mechanics in detail, providing clear guidelines and specifications for development. 
                    Additionally, I created HI-FI mock-ups for new game features, translating conceptual ideas into tangible designs that could be 
                    implemented by the development team.
