                <h3>Game Concept</h3>
                <p>
                    An underwater adventure: the player drives a submarine using the mobile phone as a controller. 
                    The submarine direction is controlled by the gyroscope of the phone, there is a gas and stop button to either accelerate or stop the submarine. 
                    In addition, there is a shooting system where the submarine needs to shoot (sea creature) to defend itself. 
                    Finally, there is a special event where an octopus appears from the back of the submarine and grabs it, 
                    here the player needs to shake the phone to break free from the octopus.

                    In my role as the principal game designer for this project, my primary responsibilities revolved around Environment and Level Design. 
                    This encompassed tasks such as creating documentation (GDD, SWOT, Reports), implementing assets in Unity, and developing the gameplay and enemy flowchart (shark's AI).

                    <ul> 
                        concluding the ideation phase and finalizing the Game Design Document (GDD), the next step in the development process was to delve into the intricacies of game mechanics.
                        To facilitate this crucial stage, I opted to construct a detailed flowchart. 
                        This visual representation proved instrumental in enhancing the conceptualization and 
                        understanding of both the gameplay dynamics and the artificial intelligence (AI) governing the sharks within the game.
                    </ul>

                    <ul> 
                        The flowchart served as a roadmap, offering a systematic depiction of the interplay between various game elements, 
                        player interactions, and the nuanced behaviors of the in-game sharks. 
                        This visualization not only provided clarity to the development team but also served as a 
                        valuable reference throughout the implementation phase. By mapping out the relationships and dependencies within the game mechanics, 
                        the flowchart became an indispensable tool in ensuring a cohesive and engaging gaming experience.
