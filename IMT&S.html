            <!-- Project Description -->
            <div class="project-description">
                <h1>WIP</h1>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>My team and I have been assigned to work on a 2D point-and-click game for the Wilminktheater in Enschede. The game is aimed at children between the ages of 5 to 10 years old. The goal is to develop a game that introduces the children to the Wilminktheater, what it is, its locations, and most importantly, its house rules. One of the issues that the theatre has been challenged with is that during school trips, the children do not behave according to the house rules of the theatre and its locations. So, we are aiming to develop a game that is engaging to the children and low-key teaches the house rules.</p> 

                <p>As one of the designers in the team, my responsibilities include the creation of the questionnaire for our target audience, visiting and contacting schools to set playtesting sessions with the children, researching online games for the creation of minigames, UI-UX, and the Game Design Document together with the lead designer. Besides these points mentioned, working closely with the team and maintaining a good flow of communication among everyone so we are all on the same page and everything runs smoothly.</p>
                </div>

            <!-- Your Participation -->
                <h1>My Participation</h1>
                <p>In this project, I took on multiple roles, including research, UI/UX design, and gameplay mechanics development. During the concept phase, I worked closely with my team to define the problem and understand our target audience, conducting research and developing questionnaires to gather insights from primary schools. This research guided our design approach to ensure that the gameplay would resonate with young children while effectively teaching theatre etiquette.</p>
                <p>I also contributed to the creation of a Game Design Document (GDD), outlining game mechanics, interactive elements, and the design thinking process. In collaboration with our artists, designers, and engineers, I helped bring our concepts to life, refining UI elements in Figma and developing prototypes in Visual Studio Code. My work included integrating feedback from playtesting sessions with children, adjusting gameplay elements to better align with their preferences and learning styles.</p>

            <!-- Concept Phase Section -->
            <div class="project-description">
                <h1>Concept Phase</h1>
            </div>
            <p>As a team, we’ve decided to approach the development process using the Double Diamond method, which allows us to thoroughly explore both the problems we’re solving and the solutions we’re creating. This method emphasizes divergent and convergent thinking—first, we identify the problem and expand our understanding, and then we narrow down solutions.</p>

            <!-- Figure 1 -->

                <figcaption>Figure 1: Double Diamond design process by Bitesizelearning.co.uk</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>For me as a designer, the concept phase focuses heavily on understanding our target audience: children aged 5-10. My role here is to ensure that the gameplay, mechanics, and overall user experience align with the needs and expectations of this age group, while still addressing the issue at hand—teaching the house rules of the Wilmink Theater. The research and insights we gather during this phase will guide how we design the game’s interactive elements and structure.</p>

            <!-- Target Audience Research -->
            <h3>Target Audience Research</h3>
            <p>One of my primary responsibilities is to gather information directly from children, which will inform the design of the game. To do this, I’m creating a questionnaire aimed at understanding what types of games children in our target group play, what keeps them engaged, and what they enjoy most about their favourite games. By asking about their preferred activities during school and lunch breaks, I can gain insight into the kind of interactions and rewards that will resonate with them in the game.</p>

            <!-- Figure 2 -->

                <figcaption>Figure 3: Empathy Map of Children</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>This questionnaire is crucial for helping me to empathize with the players. I, together with the team, will also be scheduling playtesting sessions at schools to gather feedback from the children, observing how they interact with the game and what draws their attention. This will allow us to iterate on our designs, art, and mechanics to ensure the gameplay remains fun, engaging, and educational.</p>

            <!-- Research and Inspiration -->
            <h3>Research and Inspiration</h3>
            <p>In addition to understanding the children themselves, Alexis and I started researching other educational games and interactive experiences to see what elements we could incorporate. These games have effective ways of teaching children without feeling too instructional, and that balance is exactly what we aim to achieve.</p>

            <!-- Collaboration and Team Effort -->
            <h3>Collaboration and Team Effort</h3>
            <p>During the concept phase, collaboration has been key. I’ve worked alongside our artists, engineers, and designers to brainstorm ideas and align on the overall direction for the game. We held regular meetings to discuss our findings and ensure that everyone’s input is reflected in the designs. This teamwork has allowed us to create a game that blends creative art, engaging gameplay, and educational value seamlessly.</p>

            <!-- Next Steps -->
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>The next step in the development process will be to take the insights gathered from our research and playtesting to start developing the first prototypes of the game. We’ll focus on iterating on the core mechanics and begin integrating more detailed elements like the user interface and visual design. Our goal is to ensure that each element of the game serves the dual purpose of being both fun and educational while keeping the children engaged throughout their learning journey.</p>

            <!--  DESIGN PHASE -->

            <div class="project-description">
                <h1>Design Phase</h1>
            </div>

            <section>
                <p>As a designer, the design phase places a strong emphasis on understanding the target audience, testing concepts with them, and reaching out to schools, teachers, and friends who can provide insights on children aged 5 to 10. This involves setting up appointments, gathering information, and building connections to ensure that the game effectively resonates with the needs and interests of young players.</p>
                <p>Alongside this major task, I have been focusing on developing prototypes for the game set within the theatre, using artist-created sketches to achieve a more accurate visual representation of the final product. Additionally, I have been working on ideating and creating minigame prototypes in Figma, conducting SWOT analyses based on research into similar games, and developing UI elements in Figma. To refine the concept, I’ve created some prototypes in Visual Studio Code to better convey my vision for the final minigame concept, especially for the main theatre location, which presents the biggest and most complex challenge.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges I encountered during the design phase was coordinating with a primary school willing to assist with our research and dedicate time to let the children complete the questionnaire I developed, with guidance from Yvens Serpa and a fellow artist, Thomas Reijmerink who helped with the translation and speech at the primary school. This involved scheduling an appointment and gathering the qualitative data from the children’s responses, which then needed to be organised by “groep” for further analysis.</p>
            </section>
        
            <section>
                <h3>Target Audience Engagement</h3>
                <p>As mentioned previously, I was in charge of conducting research on the target audience and contacting primary schools within the area of Enschede. To create this questionnaire, I had to do some research on how to even approach children and make them understand what is being asked of them, keep it simple and also clear to gather the best responses possible. I read websites to make this questionnaire smooth and easy to read, such as business.YouGov, Quora, and Question, which were an amazing source on how to ask basic yet straightforward questions to children, and also the help of Yvens Serpa, who helped us make the questionnaire shorter and usable for every age.</p>
                <p>Once we had the questionnaire ready, Thomas Reijmerink, a fellow artist in the group, helped with the translation since everything needed to be in Dutch. Furthermore, once this was done, it was time to start sending emails to primary schools within Enschede and also to some teachers who were willing to help us with the questionnaire.</p>
                <p>As a result of the emails, most of the schools had their agendas full, with no space for us to present the questionnaire, so one of our last options was to go in person to the school that was right behind Saxion, which is called “Prinseschool”. I knocked on the door and entered the building to speak with someone in charge and propose my idea, which actually worked. I had two meetings where I showed what we are working on, and they were more than happy to conduct a questionnaire day with the kids, so an appointment was set, and the questionnaire was conducted with the help of Thomas since it has to be done in Dutch, although it is a bilingual school.</p>

                </figure> -->
                <p>After finishing the extensive questionnaire session, it was time to write down the results, so I started to do a qualitative analysis of the over 80 questionnaires, which were divided by their respective “groep”.</p>

                <h3>Challenges and Communication with Schools</h3>
                <p>Coordinating with primary schools for playtesting and qualitative data collection proved to be a challenge. Communication was key in making sure we received useful feedback to refine the concepts. This stage also helped us gauge how well the games resonated with the children.</p>
            </section>
        
            <section>
                <h3>Concept Development and Prototyping</h3>
                <p>To explore different possibilities, I used brainstorming sessions, created concept descriptions, and sketched initial ideas. I initially focused on developing mini-games that would seamlessly integrate educational elements into gameplay, experimenting with different mechanics, themes, and styles. However, after closer consideration, we decided to shift our focus. Rather than prioritising the educational aspects, we chose to centre the mini-games on fun and entertainment, ensuring that they would capture the children's attention and keep them engaged. Collaborating closely with the team, I translated these revised ideas into low-fidelity prototypes in Figma and also developed a rough prototype in Visual Studio Code. This allowed us to test the functionality and basic interaction of the mini-games.</p>

            </section>
        
                <h3>Final Minigame Decisions</h3>
                <p>After extensive ideation and prototyping, we finalised the main theatre's mini-game, combining educational elements with interactive engagement to teach children appropriate theatre conduct. The chosen concept allows players to arrange the stage decor and adjust the lighting based on the event type, followed by a mini-game where they match falling lights to emotions of the actors on stage. This concept has been refined through various prototypes and input from team members, ultimately aligning with the client’s goals for educational yet enjoyable gameplay.</p>
        
                <h3>Iteration and Testing with Prototypes</h3>
                <p>In this phase, testing and iteration were key. Working in Figma and Visual Studio Code, I created interactive prototypes to get hands-on feedback from both the team and potential players. The prototypes included simplified versions of the lighting and decoration mini-games, allowing us to experiment with different mechanics and interaction flows to see what resonated best with the children. Through user testing and feedback sessions, I adjusted visual elements, simplified the controls, and refined the gameplay to ensure a smooth experience for our target age group.</p>
        
                <h3>SWOT Analysis and Concept Refinement</h3>
                <p>Each mini-game idea went through a SWOT analysis, helping us weigh the educational impact, potential engagement level, and feasibility. This approach allowed us to streamline the options, selecting concepts that would be fun, age-appropriate, and technically viable. For example, the lighting-matching game emerged as a clear favourite because it balanced simplicity with engagement, appealing to children’s enjoyment of vibrant colors and interactive challenges.</p>
        
                <h3>UI and UX Considerations</h3>
                <p>Developing the UI and UX of the game required particular attention to accessibility and intuitive design for young players. Using Figma, I designed large, colourful buttons and clear visual cues to make navigation and gameplay easy. I incorporated feedback from playtesting to enhance clarity, adjust button sizing, and improve the overall visual hierarchy, making sure that even first-time users could understand the mechanics without difficulty.</p>
        
                <!--  Production and Testing Phase -->

                 <div class="project-description">
                    <h1>Production and Testing Phase</h1>
                </div>

                <section>
                    <p>During this phase, the focus shifts to refining and implementing the game while making sure it truly connects with children aged 5 to 10. 
                        This means running regular playtesting sessions, listening to feedback, and working closely with schools, teachers, and friends to gather useful insights. 
                        The process involves setting up playtests, analysing what works and what doesn’t, and making improvements to gameplay, visuals, and the overall experience. 
                        The goal is to create a fun, engaging game that fits the needs of the kids and meets the expectations of the client.</p>
                    <p>As the secondary game designer of the team, my main focus relied on the game system, UI-UX, documentation, creation of the minigame, and contacting primary schools to better understand our target audience.</p>

                <h3>Iterations and Prototyping</h3>
                <h4>Stage Lighting Minigame</h4>
                <p>Since the minigame didn’t require a lot of UI besides a small to-do list for the players to complete, I started ideating minigames and then, together as a team, chose the minigame that seemed the most suitable for the first location, the Wilminktheater. 
                    Creating this UI suitable for the audience was important to keep the users engaged, but it also needed to be intuitive since, as mentioned before, the target audience is children.</p>
                <p>Starting by using a rough sketch from Thomas, one of our environmental artists, I started with the layout and mapping of where all the buttons and indicators will be located. </p>
            
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/IMT&S/Minigame Prototype.png" alt="Mini-game concept running in web">
                    <figcaption>Figure 8 First sketch for the "Stage Lighting Minigame" minigame.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>After showing this first prototype to the team and discussing some changes with Alexis, the lead designer, I gathered the feedback and started working on the possible finalised layout of the minigame.</p>
                <p>I started with the creation of the UI assets for the minigame, which is part of becoming a better UI-UX designer. 
                    This task was challenging since I’m not that good at creating art assets for the game, but I was up for the challenge. 
                    I started by researching theatrical assets and how getting inspired by old theatre looks from the ’60s and ’70s while keeping in mind the colour pallet and aesthetics of the Wilminktheater.</p>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/IMT&S/UI minigame.png" alt="Mini-game concept running in web">
                    <figcaption>Figure 9 elements for the minigame.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>	After discussing the UI elements with the artist, getting feedback, applying it and finalising the final assets, the UI elements were ready to be implemented.</p>

                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Figure 10 Final UI placement for the minigame..</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>I was proud of how this UI ended up looking on the game. Once all the assets were imported to Unity and the placeholders were swapped by the new assets, the final minigame looked way better.   </p>

                <h4>Challenges faced during ideation:</h4>

                <p>Based on the feedback, the UI elements were a good match with the overall environment; they were not distracting or taking too much attention from the player’s focus, and it was clear and intuitive.</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Character Customisation UI</h3>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/IMT&S/Charactercustomisationui.png" alt="Mini-game concept in Visual Studio Code">
                        <figcaption>Figure 12: Character Customisation Sheet made by Kit</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>The character customisation for the game was. Based on the questionnaire conducted by Thomas and me, we found out that a great majority of people prefer customisation options when their character is being created, for over 80% based on the qualitative and quantitative reports I made based on the questionnaires. With this in mind, it was time to make a simplistic yet fun and intuitive UI for the kids to customise their characters.  </p>

                    <p> I started researching multiple games and their character-creation UI, and after gathering some ideas, I started to block out a simple sketch design based on a minimal-value product (MVP) since the amount of time the project had left wasn’t enough to create more cosmetics for the character to have.</p>
                        
                    <p>Based on the character customisation sheet made by Kit, the artist in charge of the character creation and cosmetics, and the research made, I made the first hi-fi mock-up using some assets that were available to make it as realistic as possible for the final product. I made two approaches; one based on the MVP and the other one as a full-featured product.</p>
                      
                    <figure>

                    </figure>

                    <p>After showing both designs to the team, they liked the idea of both approaches. However, they said that it might look a bit too busy and not centred enough. Knowing that I was going on the correct path, I started to move some assets around and changed the background since the one used seemed to not match, and it didn’t look good.</p>
                
                    <figure>

                    </figure>

                    <p>This approach seems to be more likeable and what my team and I were looking for. However, a more appealing approach needed to be created for the kids. It looked nice and intuitive; however, it looked boring and simplistic, therefore I decided to keep the idea of the colour stains.</p>
                        
                    <p>I continued using the same layout but swapped the names with the stains, resulting in the character customisation UI of the project shown in Figure 17. Additionally, I utilised the same assets I created for the instructions on the website in the minigame instructions for greater consistency across both platforms.</p>

                    <h3>Questionnaire for Children</h3>
                    <p>As I had mentioned, the construction of the questionnaire was to relate to our client group; hence, as this is my first time dealing with children, I performed some research on setting up an interesting and efficient form.
                    <p>When creating the questionnaire, I first researched how questionnaires have been constructed in the past so that children could understand how they are laid out and why. During my search, I found useful resources from many websites, some of them being the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), LinkedIn, and Qeryz. Using the information learned from these resources, I compiled a checklist of do's and don'ts for writing the questionnaire. Important considerations included:</p>

                    <p> Once the first draft was done, I needed to get someone with knowledge of the subject to look over it. Yvens Serpa was an excellent candidate for this because of his background as a game design teacher and the fact that he has been supportive throughout my CMGT journey whenever I needed good input on any matter.</p>
                    <p> Yvens provided a lot of insightful and actionable feedback that greatly improved the final questionnaire. The first draft had more than 12 questions, all well-phrased but too much for younger children to handle. He guided me through shortening, simplifying, and making the questionnaire more child-friendly. For fun, we inserted at the end of the paper a playful question in which we asked the children to draw a character on the back of the paper. This adjustment not only lightened the tone but gave more insight into the children's creativity and preferences.</p>

                    <p>After finishing the questionnaire by applying the feedback, it was time to translate it into Dutch since our target audience was children from primary schools in the Netherlands, Thomas translated it in such a way as to keep it still simple and understandable, with a great tone of voice for the kids.</p>

                    <p>Even though there is an extensive reflection document, I wanted to write something to include here briefly.</p>
                    <p> Working on this project allowed me to grow as a designer by tackling new challenges, such as creating an age-appropriate questionnaire and designing intuitive UI/UX elements. I developed valuable skills in iteration, collaboration, and balancing functionality with user engagement.</p>
                    <p> Coordinating playtesting sessions and managing multiple responsibilities highlighted areas for improvement, such as communication and time management, which I’ve actively worked on.</p>
                    <p> Overall, this experience reinforced my passion for creating engaging, interactive systems and strengthened my ability to approach design creatively and purposefully.</p>
