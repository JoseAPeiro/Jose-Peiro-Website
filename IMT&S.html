                    This project is an interactive educational game designed for the Wilmink Theatre, 
                    aimed at teaching children between the ages of 5 and 10 the theatreâ€™s house rules in a playful, engaging way. 
                    The game incorporates a point-and-click adventure style with vibrant 2D visuals and intuitive mechanics that encourage exploration and learning. 
                    Set across four locations within the theatre complex, players are tasked with reducing chaos by learning and practicing proper theatre etiquette.

                    In this project, I took on multiple roles, including research, UI/UX design, and gameplay mechanics development. 
                    During the concept phase, I worked closely with my team to define the problem and understand our target audience, conducting research and 
                    developing questionnaires to gather insights from primary schools. This research guided our design approach to ensure that the gameplay would 
                    resonate with young children while effectively teaching theatre etiquette.

                    I also contributed to the creation of a Game Design Document (GDD), outlining game mechanics, interactive elements, 
                    and the design thinking process. In collaboration with our artists, designers, and engineers, I helped bring our concepts to life, 
                    refining UI elements in Figma and developing prototypes in Visual Studio Code. 
                    My work included integrating feedback from playtesting sessions with children, adjusting gameplay elements to better align with their 
                    preferences and learning styles.
