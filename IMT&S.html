                <h1>WIP</h1>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This project is an interactive educational game designed for the Wilmink Theatre, aimed at teaching children between the ages of 5 and 10 the theatre’s house rules in a playful, engaging way. The game incorporates a point-and-click adventure style with vibrant 2D visuals and intuitive mechanics that encourage exploration and learning. Set across four locations within the theatre complex, players are tasked with reducing chaos by learning and practicing proper theatre etiquette.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Your Participation -->
                <h1>My Participation</h1>
                <p>In this project, I took on multiple roles, including research, UI/UX design, and gameplay mechanics development. During the concept phase, I worked closely with my team to define the problem and understand our target audience, conducting research and developing questionnaires to gather insights from primary schools. This research guided our design approach to ensure that the gameplay would resonate with young children while effectively teaching theatre etiquette.</p>
                <p>I also contributed to the creation of a Game Design Document (GDD), outlining game mechanics, interactive elements, and the design thinking process. In collaboration with our artists, designers, and engineers, I helped bring our concepts to life, refining UI elements in Figma and developing prototypes in Visual Studio Code. My work included integrating feedback from playtesting sessions with children, adjusting gameplay elements to better align with their preferences and learning styles.</p>

            <!-- Concept Phase Section -->
            <div class="project-description">
                <h1>Concept Phase</h1>
            </div>
            <p>As a team, we’ve decided to approach the development process using the Double Diamond method, which allows us to thoroughly explore both the problems we’re solving and the solutions we’re creating. This method emphasizes divergent and convergent thinking—first, we identify the problem and expand our understanding, and then we narrow down solutions.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>For me as a designer, the concept phase focuses heavily on understanding our target audience: children aged 5-10. My role here is to ensure that the gameplay, mechanics, and overall user experience align with the needs and expectations of this age group, while still addressing the issue at hand—teaching the house rules of the Wilmink Theater. The research and insights we gather during this phase will guide how we design the game’s interactive elements and structure.</p>

            <!-- Target Audience Research -->
            <h3>Target Audience Research</h3>
            <p>One of my primary responsibilities is to gather information directly from children, which will inform the design of the game. To do this, I’m creating a questionnaire aimed at understanding what types of games children in our target group play, what keeps them engaged, and what they enjoy most about their favourite games. By asking about their preferred activities during school and lunch breaks, I can gain insight into the kind of interactions and rewards that will resonate with them in the game.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>This questionnaire is crucial for helping me to empathize with the players. I, together with the team, will also be scheduling playtesting sessions at schools to gather feedback from the children, observing how they interact with the game and what draws their attention. This will allow us to iterate on our designs, art, and mechanics to ensure the gameplay remains fun, engaging, and educational.</p>

            <!-- Research and Inspiration -->
            <h3>Research and Inspiration</h3>
            <p>In addition to understanding the children themselves, Alexis and I started researching other educational games and interactive experiences to see what elements we could incorporate. These games have effective ways of teaching children without feeling too instructional, and that balance is exactly what we aim to achieve.</p>

            <!-- Collaboration and Team Effort -->
            <h3>Collaboration and Team Effort</h3>
            <p>During the concept phase, collaboration has been key. I’ve worked alongside our artists, engineers, and designers to brainstorm ideas and align on the overall direction for the game. We held regular meetings to discuss our findings and ensure that everyone’s input is reflected in the designs. This teamwork has allowed us to create a game that blends creative art, engaging gameplay, and educational value seamlessly.</p>

            <!-- Next Steps -->
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>The next step in the development process will be to take the insights gathered from our research and playtesting to start developing the first prototypes of the game. We’ll focus on iterating on the core mechanics and begin integrating more detailed elements like the user interface and visual design. Our goal is to ensure that each element of the game serves the dual purpose of being both fun and educational while keeping the children engaged throughout their learning journey.</p>

            <!--  DESIGN PHASE -->

            <div class="project-description">
                <h1>Design Phase</h1>
            </div>

            <section>
                <p>As a designer, the design phase places a strong emphasis on understanding the target audience, testing concepts with them, and reaching out to schools, teachers, and friends who can provide insights on children aged 5 to 10. This involves setting up appointments, gathering information, and building connections to ensure that the game effectively resonates with the needs and interests of young players.</p>
                <p>Alongside this major task, I have been focusing on developing prototypes for the game set within the theatre, using artist-created sketches to achieve a more accurate visual representation of the final product. Additionally, I have been working on ideating and creating minigame prototypes in Figma, conducting SWOT analyses based on research into similar games, and developing UI elements in Figma. To refine the concept, I’ve created some prototypes in Visual Studio Code to better convey my vision for the final minigame concept, especially for the main theatre location, which presents the biggest and most complex challenge.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges I encountered during the design phase was coordinating with a primary school willing to assist with our research and dedicate time to let the children complete the questionnaire I developed, with guidance from Yvens Serpa and a fellow artist, Thomas Reijmerink who helped with the translation and speech at the primary school. This involved scheduling an appointment and gathering the qualitative data from the children’s responses, which then needed to be organised by “groep” for further analysis.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Target Audience Engagement</h3>
                <p>As mentioned previously, I was in charge of conducting research on the target audience and contacting primary schools within the area of Enschede. To create this questionnaire, I had to do some research on how to even approach children and make them understand what is being asked of them, keep it simple and also clear to gather the best responses possible. I read websites to make this questionnaire smooth and easy to read, such as business.YouGov, Quora, and Question, which were an amazing source on how to ask basic yet straightforward questions to children, and also the help of Yvens Serpa, who helped us make the questionnaire shorter and usable for every age.</p>
                <p>Once we had the questionnaire ready, Thomas Reijmerink, a fellow artist in the group, helped with the translation since everything needed to be in Dutch. Furthermore, once this was done, it was time to start sending emails to primary schools within Enschede and also to some teachers who were willing to help us with the questionnaire.</p>
                <p>As a result of the emails, most of the schools had their agendas full, with no space for us to present the questionnaire, so one of our last options was to go in person to the school that was right behind Saxion, which is called “Prinseschool”. I knocked on the door and entered the building to speak with someone in charge and propose my idea, which actually worked. I had two meetings where I showed what we are working on, and they were more than happy to conduct a questionnaire day with the kids, so an appointment was set, and the questionnaire was conducted with the help of Thomas since it has to be done in Dutch, although it is a bilingual school.</p>

                <p>After finishing the extensive questionnaire session, it was time to write down the results, so I started to do a qualitative analysis of the over 80 questionnaires, which were divided by their respective “groep”.</p>

                <h3>Challenges and Communication with Schools</h3>
                <p>Coordinating with primary schools for playtesting and qualitative data collection proved to be a challenge. Communication was key in making sure we received useful feedback to refine the concepts. This stage also helped us gauge how well the games resonated with the children.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Concept Development and Prototyping</h3>
                <p>To explore different possibilities, I used brainstorming sessions, created concept descriptions, and sketched initial ideas. I initially focused on developing mini-games that would seamlessly integrate educational elements into gameplay, experimenting with different mechanics, themes, and styles. However, after closer consideration, we decided to shift our focus. Rather than prioritising the educational aspects, we chose to centre the mini-games on fun and entertainment, ensuring that they would capture the children's attention and keep them engaged. Collaborating closely with the team, I translated these revised ideas into low-fidelity prototypes in Figma and also developed a rough prototype in Visual Studio Code. This allowed us to test the functionality and basic interaction of the mini-games.</p>

            </section>
        
                <h3>Final Minigame Decisions</h3>
                <p>After extensive ideation and prototyping, we finalised the main theatre's mini-game, combining educational elements with interactive engagement to teach children appropriate theatre conduct. The chosen concept allows players to arrange the stage decor and adjust the lighting based on the event type, followed by a mini-game where they match falling lights to emotions of the actors on stage. This concept has been refined through various prototypes and input from team members, ultimately aligning with the client’s goals for educational yet enjoyable gameplay.</p>
        
                <h3>Iteration and Testing with Prototypes</h3>
                <p>In this phase, testing and iteration were key. Working in Figma and Visual Studio Code, I created interactive prototypes to get hands-on feedback from both the team and potential players. The prototypes included simplified versions of the lighting and decoration mini-games, allowing us to experiment with different mechanics and interaction flows to see what resonated best with the children. Through user testing and feedback sessions, I adjusted visual elements, simplified the controls, and refined the gameplay to ensure a smooth experience for our target age group.</p>
        
                <h3>SWOT Analysis and Concept Refinement</h3>
                <p>Each mini-game idea went through a SWOT analysis, helping us weigh the educational impact, potential engagement level, and feasibility. This approach allowed us to streamline the options, selecting concepts that would be fun, age-appropriate, and technically viable. For example, the lighting-matching game emerged as a clear favourite because it balanced simplicity with engagement, appealing to children’s enjoyment of vibrant colors and interactive challenges.</p>
        
                <h3>UI and UX Considerations</h3>
                <p>Developing the UI and UX of the game required particular attention to accessibility and intuitive design for young players. Using Figma, I designed large, colourful buttons and clear visual cues to make navigation and gameplay easy. I incorporated feedback from playtesting to enhance clarity, adjust button sizing, and improve the overall visual hierarchy, making sure that even first-time users could understand the mechanics without difficulty.</p>
